Project: Basic Contact Management System in C++ with CI/CD Integration

Description:
Create a basic contact management system in C++ that allows users to store and manage their contacts. 
This project aims to demonstrate various skills expected from a junior C++ developer, including data structures,
 file handling, user input validation, error handling, and modern software development practices like CI/CD integration.

Key Features:

Contact Management:

Implement functionalities to add, view, update, and delete contacts.
Store contact information such as name, phone number, email address, and any other relevant details.
File Handling:

Use file I/O to save contact data to a file for persistent storage.
Implement functionalities to load contact data from a file when the program starts and save changes back to the file upon exit.
User Interface:

Develop a simple command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the contact management system.
Include options for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting contacts, as well as exiting the program.
User Input Validation:

Validate user input to ensure that contact information is entered correctly and consistently.
Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the user when input validation fails.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected errors and exceptions during program execution.
Ensure that the program does not crash or behave unpredictably when errors occur.
Build System and Version Control:

Use Git for version control to track project changes.
Implement CMake as the build system for compiling and building the project.
Continuous Integration (CI):

Set up a CI pipeline using a CI service (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
Configure CI jobs to automatically build and test the project whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
Automated Testing:

Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of key functionalities.
Include integration tests to verify the overall behavior of the contact management system.
Continuous Deployment (CD):

Configure CD jobs to automatically deploy the application when changes are merged into the main branch and all tests pass.
Explore options for distributing the contact management system (e.g., creating installers or packages).
Brief Question:
Develop a basic contact management system in C++ that incorporates the following aspects:

Contact management functionalities, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting contacts.
Use of file I/O for persistent storage of contact data.
Implementation of a simple command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
User input validation and error handling to ensure data integrity.
Integration of modern software development practices such as version control (Git), build systems (CMake), and CI/CD integration using a chosen CI service (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
This question aims to assess your skills in C++ programming, data structures, file handling, user input validation, error handling, build systems (CMake), version control (Git), and modern development practices with CI/CD integration.

This project provides a hands-on opportunity for a junior C++ developer to apply various programming concepts and practices in a practical project scenario. It covers essential aspects of software development, from designing and implementing features to integrating CI/CD pipelines for automated building, testing, and deployment.
